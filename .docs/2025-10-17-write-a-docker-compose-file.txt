> write a Docker Compose file 

● I'll create a Docker Compose file for your project. Let me first explore the codebase to understand what services you
need.

● Now I understand this is a WebRTC-based random video chat application that uses PeerJS. I'll create a Docker Compose
file that sets up both a web server for the static files and a PeerJS signaling server.

● I've created a Docker Compose setup for your domingle video chat application. Here's what was created:

docker-compose.yml
- web service: Nginx server to serve your static files (HTML, CSS, JS) on port 8080
- peerjs service: PeerJS signaling server for WebRTC connections on port 9000
- Both services are connected via a private network

nginx.conf
- Configured to serve static files from the root directory
- Includes gzip compression for better performance
- Proxies /peerjs requests to the PeerJS server for WebRTC signaling
- Optimized caching for static assets

.dockerignore
- Excludes unnecessary files from the Docker context

To use it:

# Start the services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the services
docker compose down

The application will be available at:
- Web app: http://localhost:8080
- PeerJS server: http://localhost:9000

Note: You may need to update your JavaScript code to point to the correct PeerJS server URL (http://localhost:9000) if
it's currently hardcoded to use the public PeerJS cloud service.
